# Unique_Identifier_And_Metadata_File_Creator

This F# app was successfully used in production. However, it serves as a learning app for the author of the code as well. Therefore, the code may contain some ostensibly "redundant" or "strange-looking" code. The operation of this desktop app was undertaken under my supervision, therefore exceptions and validations were coded accordingly.

Nowadays, I would code it in a different way, of course. For example, I would transition to idiomatic Result-type error-handling while departing from my previous unsuccessful attempts at railway-oriented-style error handling. Moreover, I would adopt a more judicious approach to Option-type usage, minimizing unnecessary caution.

Legacy C# code in the files GoogleSheetsHelper.cs, CreateCsvFile.cs, and CreateExcelFile.cs is not mine.
